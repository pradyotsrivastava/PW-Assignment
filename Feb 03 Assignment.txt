1. What is a String in Java?
Strings, which are widely used in Java programming, are a sequence of characters. In the Java programming language,
strings are objects. The Java platform provides the String class to create and manipulate strings.

4. What is a String constant pool?
The String constant pool is a special memory area. When we declare a String literal, the JVM creates the object in the
pool and stores its reference on the stack. 

5. What do you mean by mutable and immutable objects?
The mutable objects are objects whose value can be changed after initialization. We can change the object's values,
such as field and states, after the object is created. For example, Java.util.Date, StringBuilder, StringBuffer, etc.
The immutable objects are objects whose value can not be changed after initialization. We can not change anything once
the object is created. For example, primitive objects such as int, long, float, double, class, String class, etc.

6. Where exactly is the String constant pool located in the memory?
String pool is a storage space in the Java heap memory where string literals are stored.
