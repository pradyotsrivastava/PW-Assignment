1. What are the Conditional Operators in Java?
There are three types of the conditional operator in Java:

Conditional AND
Conditional OR
Ternary Operator

2. What are the types of operators based on the number of operands?
There are two types of mathematical operators: unary and binary. Unary operators perform an action with a 
single operand. Binary operators perform actions with two operands. 

3. What is the use of Switch case in Java programming?
The switch statement or switch case in java is a multi-way branch statement. Based on the value of the expression
given, different parts of code can be executed quickly. The given expression can be of a primitive data type such
as int, char, short, byte, and char.

4. What are the priority levels of arithmetic operation in Java?
An arithmetic operation is solve from Left-To-Right and the order of precedence of operators are Paranthesis, 
Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction.

5. What are the conditional Statements and use of conditional statements in Java?
Java has the following conditional statements: Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified
condition is true. Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false. Use else if
to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false.

6. What is the syntax of if else statement>
if (condition) {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition is true
} 
else {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition is false
}

7. What are the 3 types of iterative statements in Java>
For loop
While loop
Do-while loop

8. Write the difference between for loop and do-while loop?
for loop provides a concise way of writing the loop structure. Unlike a while loop, a for statement consumes the
initialization, condition and increment/decrement in one line thereby providing a shorter, easy to debug structure
of looping.
do while loop is similar to while loop with the only difference that it checks for the condition after executing
the statements, and therefore is an example of Exit Control Loop.

9. Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 10.
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for(int i=1; i<=10; i++){
            System.out.println(i);
        }
    }
}
