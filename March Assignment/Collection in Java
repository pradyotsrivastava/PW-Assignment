1. What is the Collection framework in Java?
The Collection framework in Java is a unified architecture that provides interfaces, implementations, and algorithms to represent and manipulate a group of objects known as elements. It is a part of the Java API and includes interfaces such as List, Set, Map, and their respective implementations, along with utility classes like Collections for sorting and searching.

2. What is the difference between ArrayList and LinkedList?
ArrayList:

Implements the List interface.
Backed by a resizable array.
Provides fast random access and better performance for get operations.
Slower for add and remove operations in the middle of the list.
LinkedList:

Implements the List interface.
Backed by a doubly-linked list.
Provides fast add and remove operations, especially in the middle.
Slower for random access and get operations.

3. What is the difference between Iterator and ListIterator?
Iterator:

Available in the java.util package.
Allows forward-only traversal.
Can be used with any collection that implements the Iterable interface.
Supports hasNext() and next() methods.
ListIterator:

Available in the java.util package.
Extends Iterator and provides additional methods.
Allows bidirectional traversal (forward and backward).
Specifically designed for lists and supports hasNext(), next(), hasPrevious(), previous(), etc.

4. What is the difference between Iterator and Enumeration?
Iterator:

Introduced in Java 1.2.
Part of the Collections framework.
Supports both read and remove operations.
More powerful and flexible.
Enumeration:

Deprecated in Java 1.0 and replaced by Iterator.
Part of the original Collections framework.
Supports only read operations.
Less powerful and flexible than Iterator.

5. What is the difference between List and Set?
List:

Ordered collection (maintains the order of elements).
Allows duplicate elements.
Accessed by index.
Implementations include ArrayList, LinkedList, etc.
Set:

Unordered collection.
Does not allow duplicate elements.
No index-based access.
Implementations include HashSet, TreeSet, etc.

6. What is the difference between HashSet and TreeSet?
HashSet:

Does not maintain any order.
Allows null elements.
Implemented using a hash table.
Generally faster than TreeSet.
TreeSet:

Maintains natural order or order specified by a comparator.
Does not allow null elements.
Implemented using a Red-Black tree.
Slower than HashSet for add, remove, and contains operations.

7. What is the difference between Array and ArrayList?
Array:

Fixed size once declared.
Can store primitive types and objects.
Provides direct access using index.
No built-in methods for dynamic operations.
ArrayList:

Dynamic size (can grow or shrink).
Can only store objects (not primitive types directly).
Provides built-in methods for dynamic operations like add, remove, etc.
Uses an underlying array, but handles resizing automatically.
