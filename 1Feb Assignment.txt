1. What do you mean by an array?
An array is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type. The length of an 
array is established when the array is created. After creation, its length is fixed.

2. How to create an array?
An array declaration has two components: the type and the name. type declares the element type of the 
array. The element type determines the data type of each element that comprises the array.
type var-name[];
OR
type[] var-name;

3. Can we change the size of an array at run time?
No, because array size cannot be changed once initialized.

4. Can you declare an array without assigning the size of an array?
Yes. We can declare an array without size but before using it needs to be initialized

5. What is the default value of array?
Since no values are passed during initialization, all elements of the array are set to their default 
value of 0.

6. What is a 1D array with an example?
A One-Dimensional Array is the simplest form of an Array in which the elements are stored linearly and 
can be accessed individually by specifying the index value of each element stored in the array. Example:-
data-type var-name[];
       OR 
data-type[] var-name;
       OR
data-type []var-name;    

7. Write a program on a 2D array?
class array2D {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        int a[][] = {
            {1, -2, 3}, 
            {-4, -5, 6, 9}, 
            {7}, 
        };
      
        for (int i = 0; i < a.length; ++i) {
            for(int j = 0; j < a[i].length; ++j) {
                System.out.println(a[i][j]);
            }
        }
    }
}
