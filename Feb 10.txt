1. What is a Constructor?
A constructor in Java is a special type of method that is used to initialize the objects of a class. It has the same name as the class and does not have a return type. Constructors are called automatically when an object of the class is created. They are used to set initial values for the object's attributes or perform any necessary setup.

2. What is Constructor Chaining?
Constructor chaining is the process of calling one constructor from another within the same class or from the subclass constructor to the superclass constructor. It is achieved using the this() or super() keywords.

public class Example {
    private int x;

    // Constructor 1
    public Example() {
        this(0);  // Calling another constructor in the same class
    }

    // Constructor 2
    public Example(int x) {
        this.x = x;
    }
}

3. Can we call a subclass constructor from a superclass constructor?
Yes, you can call a subclass constructor from a superclass constructor using the super() keyword. It should be the first statement in the constructor.

public class Superclass {
    public Superclass() {
        // Superclass constructor
    }
}

public class Subclass extends Superclass {
    public Subclass() {
        super();  // Calling superclass constructor
        // Subclass constructor
    }
}

4. What happens if you keep a return type for a constructor?
A constructor cannot have a return type. If you attempt to specify a return type for a constructor, it will be treated as a regular method, and the compiler will generate an error.

// Incorrect declaration of a constructor with a return type
public class Example {
    public Example() {
        // Error: Constructor cannot have a return type
    }
}

5. What is No-arg constructor?
A no-arg constructor (no-argument constructor) is a constructor that takes no parameters. It is a constructor with an empty parameter list. If a class does not explicitly define any constructors, Java provides a default no-arg constructor.

6. How is a No-argument constructor different from the default Constructor?
A no-argument constructor is a constructor that does not take any parameters, but it may still be user-defined. On the other hand, the default constructor is provided by Java automatically if no constructors are explicitly defined in a class. The default constructor is always a no-arg constructor, and if you define any constructor (including a no-arg constructor), the default constructor is not provided.

// No-argument constructor
public class Example {
    public Example() {
        // No-arg constructor
    }
}

// Default constructor (no constructor defined explicitly)
public class AnotherExample {
    // Compiler provides a default no-arg constructor
}

7. When do we need Constructor Overloading?
Constructor overloading is needed when you want to create multiple constructors in a class, each with a different parameter list. This allows objects of the class to be initialized in various ways based on the provided arguments.

public class Example {
    private int x;
    private String name;

    // Constructor with one parameter
    public Example(int x) {
        this.x = x;
    }

    // Constructor with two parameters
    public Example(int x, String name) {
        this.x = x;
        this.name = name;
    }
}

8. What is Default constructor? Explain with an Example.
The default constructor is a no-arg constructor provided by Java if no constructors are explicitly defined in a class. It initializes the object with default values. If any constructor is defined in the class (including a no-arg constructor), the default constructor is not automatically provided.
// Default constructor (no constructor defined explicitly)
public class Example {
    // Compiler provides a default no-arg constructor
}
In this example, if no other constructors are defined in the Example class, a default no-arg constructor will be provided by the compiler.
